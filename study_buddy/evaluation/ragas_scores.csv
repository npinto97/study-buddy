If confronted with the token saw, stemming might return just s, whereas lemmatization would attempt to return either see or saw depending on whether the use of the token was as a verb or a noun. The two may also differ in that stemming most commonly collapses derivationally related words, whereas lemmatiza- tion commonly only collapses the different inﬂectional forms of a lemma.', 'The goal of both stemming and lemmatization is to reduce inﬂectional forms and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form.

In other words, stemming is a more simplistic approach that may not always produce the correct base form, whereas lemmatization is a more sophisticated approach that aims to produce the correct dictionary headword form.","Stemming is a crude heuristic process that chops off the ends of words to achieve a common base, while lemmatization uses a vocabulary and morphological analysis to return the base or dictionary form of a word (the lemma).",1.0,0.8587114391397817,0.94999999997625,1.0
