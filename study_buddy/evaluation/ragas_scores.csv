In the SIIA course, the teaching methods include a combination of theoretical lessons and hands-on classroom exercises. The course covers topics such as semantics and content representation, endogenous (implicit) semantics, and semantics-aware systems for intelligent information access. The hands-on exercises provide students with practical experience in analyzing and applying semantic technologies.

In contrast, the MRI course focuses on the theoretical and practical foundations for the realization of information retrieval and filtering systems. The course includes lezioni frontali (lectures) and esercitazioni (exercises), with a emphasis on the evaluation of recommender systems.

In contrast, various professional searchers such as paralegals and intelligence analysts are very concerned with trying to get as high recallas possible, andwill tolerate', 'To evaluate top-N recommendation we use two metrics widely used in the information retrieval (IR) community namely recall and precision. However, we slightly modify the definition of recall and precision as our experiment is different from standard IR. We divide the products into two sets: the test set and top-N set. Products that appear in both sets are members of the hit set. We now define recall and precision as the following: § Recall in the context of the recommender']","The trade-off between precision and recall is that increasing one often comes at the expense of the other. In the context of classification, precision refers to the probability that a document classified under a certain category actually belongs to that category, while recall refers to the probability that a document that belongs to a certain category is correctly classified.

To tune a classifier to favor one over the other, one can adjust the threshold used to determine whether a document is classified under a certain category. A higher threshold will tend to increase precision but decrease recall, while a lower threshold will tend to increase recall but decrease precision.

For example, in the context of text categorization, a classifier can be tuned to favor precision by setting a higher threshold for classification, which will result in fewer false positives but may also miss some true positives. On the other hand, a classifier can be tuned to favor recall by setting a lower threshold, which will result in more true positives but may also include more false positives.

The F1 metric, which gives equal weight to both precision and recall, can be used to evaluate the performance of a classifier. It is computed as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and is often used to compare the performance of different classifiers.

In summary, the trade-off between precision and recall is a fundamental aspect of classification, and tuning a classifier to favor one over the other requires adjusting the threshold used for classification. The F1 metric provides a way to evaluate the performance of a classifier in terms of both precision and recall.","According to the text, precision and recall do not make sense in isolation from each other, as higher levels of recall can be obtained at the price of low precision. A classifier can be tuned to be more 'liberal' to improve recall at the detriment of precision, or more 'conservative' to improve precision at the detriment of recall.",0.7058823529411765,0.9479319399340218,0.9999999999666667,1.0

This limitation was largely due to the challenges in handling the diversity and complexity of LOD data, which often required sophisticated data processing and integration techniques.

This problem was later addressed through various advancements and techniques, including:

1. **Development of more sophisticated data integration and processing methods**: Researchers developed more effective methods for integrating, processing, and utilizing LOD data, such as using semantic similarity measures, matrix factorization models, and personalized linked data semantic distance measures.
2. **Improvements in recommender system algorithms**: Advances in recommender system algorithms, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches, enabled better utilization of LOD-based features and improved recommendation accuracy.
3. **Increased use of knowledge graph embeddings**: Knowledge graph embeddings, which represent entities and relationships in a low-dimensional vector space, have been increasingly used to effectively integrate and utilize LOD data in recommender systems.
4. **Development of more efficient and scalable systems**: The development of more efficient and scalable systems, such as distributed computing frameworks and cloud-based infrastructure, has enabled the processing and integration of large-scale LOD data, making it more feasible to use LOD-based features in recommender systems.

1. **Co-occurrence bias**: The technique may be biased towards frequent co-occurrences, which may not always indicate a strong relationship between aspects (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-025-02405-7).
2. **Lack of contextual understanding**: The Co-occurrence technique may not capture the nuances of language and the context in which aspects are mentioned, leading to inaccurate identifications (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095070511400450X).

1. Pre-training a large language model on a large dataset in the source language.
2. Fine-tuning the pre-trained model on a smaller dataset in the target language.

For example, the paper ""Two-step masked language model for domain-adapting multi-modal task-oriented dialogue systems"" by Y. Ko (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10209234/) describes a two-step approach for domain adaptation, where the first step involves pre-training a masked language model on a large dataset, and the second step involves fine-tuning the model on a smaller dataset in the target domain.

"What is the general effect of iterative correction, and how many rounds are typically needed to see the most benefit?","['The key control parameter for the BNB algorithm was the number of iterations al- lowed.

We also observe that the gain in rec- ommendation quality decreased as the number of iterations increased. Difference in recommendation quality was small between 70 and 100 iterations.', 'The results shown in Figures 4, 5 and 6 clearly demonstrate that the strategy of revising an initial user proﬁle is more accurate than the other two strategies. The beneﬁt of the revision strategy is most dramatic for the goats problem where the other two strategies are approximately 70% accurate and the revision strategy is approximately 85% accurate.

In the latter case, the off-line training of the model takes thus slightly less than 1 hour, while off-line training using early- stopping takes less than 20 minutes. For models with larger k, the training time grows proportionally in k.']","The general effect of iterative correction is to improve the accuracy and reliability of a process or system by repeatedly applying corrections or refinements. The number of rounds needed to see the most benefit can vary depending on the specific application and context.

In some cases, such as in error correction codes, iterative correction can achieve significant improvements in accuracy with just a few rounds. For example, turbo codes and low-density parity-check codes can achieve near-optimal performance with just 2-5 iterations.

In other cases, such as in data quality correction, iterative correction may require more rounds to achieve significant improvements. For example, a study on data quality correction for Mendelssohn string quartets found that 5-10 iterations were needed to achieve significant improvements in data quality.

In general, the number of rounds needed will depend on the specific problem being addressed, the quality of the initial data or estimates, and the effectiveness of the correction process. It is often necessary to experiment with different numbers of iterations to determine the optimal number for a given application.

Some relevant sources that discuss the effect of iterative correction and the number of rounds needed include:

* ""Iterative error correction: Turbo, low-density parity-check and repeat-accumulate codes"" by SJ Johnson
* ""Data quality matters: Iterative corrections on a corpus of Mendelssohn string quartets and implications for MIR analysis"" by T de Reuse

* ""Use of the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm as a generic solver for mixed-model equations in animal breeding applications"" by S Tsuruta, I Misztal, and I Stranden

1. **Lack of consideration for precision**: NR only focuses on recall, which can lead to a lack of consideration for precision, potentially resulting in a high number of irrelevant documents being retrieved.
2. **Sensitivity to document ranking**: NR is sensitive to the ranking of documents, which can lead to inconsistent results if the ranking algorithm changes.
3. **Difficulty in comparing systems**: NR can make it difficult to compare the performance of different information retrieval systems, as it only provides a recall-oriented measure.
4. **Limited interpretability**: NR can be difficult to interpret, especially for non-experts, as it requires a good understanding of the underlying retrieval system and the dataset being used.
5. **Vulnerability to bias**: NR can be vulnerable to bias in the dataset or the retrieval system, which can lead to inaccurate or unfair evaluations.

These limitations highlight the importance of using multiple evaluation measures, such as precision, F1-score, and mean average precision, in addition to NR, to get a more comprehensive understanding of an information retrieval system's performance.","The Normalized Recall (NR) measure has two key limitations.

AMIE 3 is a rule mining algorithm that guarantees both speed and exhaustivity. It scales to larger KBs and can discover more complex rules. The algorithm uses a combination of pruning strategies, parallelization, and lazy confidence scores computation to speed up the rule mining process. AMIE 3 is faster than OP and RuDiK, and it finds the largest set of rules. The algorithm also has the advantage of being exact and complete, which makes it suitable for rule mining on large knowledge graphs on smaller machines with fewer resources. The algorithm has been compared to OP and RuDiK in terms of runtime performance and output of different rule mining approaches. AMIE 3 outperforms both OP and RuDiK in terms of runtime and the number of rules. The algorithm is also able to mine some relations that are not even covered by RuDiK or OP. AMIE 3 is the fastest approach currently available and finds the largest set of rules. It has to load the whole graph into main memory, which makes it suitable for very large knowledge graphs on relatively smaller machines with fewer resources. RuDiK on the other hand is based on a parallel architecture and does not load the entire graph in memory, which makes it suitable for rule-mining on large knowledge graphs on relatively smaller machines with fewer resources. AMIE 3 has been evaluated on several datasets, including YAGO2s, DBpedia 3.8, and Wikidata 2019. The algorithm has been compared to other rule mining algorithms, including AMIE, AMIE+, and RuDiK. AMIE 3 has been shown to be faster than AMIE and AMIE+ in terms of runtime, and it has been shown to be more efficient than RuDiK in terms of runtime.
