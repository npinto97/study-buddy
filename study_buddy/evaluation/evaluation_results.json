Chapter 2 builds on this introduction by de- tailing the manner in which documents are preprocessed before indexing and by discussing how inverted indexes are augmented in various ways for functionality and speed. Chapter 3 discusses search structures for dictionar- ies and how to process queries that have spelling errors and other imprecise matches to the vocabulary in the document collection being searched. Chap- ter 4 describes a number of algorithms for constructing the inverted index from a text collection with particular attention to highly scalable and dis- tributed algorithms that can be applied to very large collections.

These benchmarks have been collected and run for al- most 20 years in the context of the EVALITA campaigns (https://www.evalita.it/). The campaigns have fostered the creation of training and evaluation resources and models natively developed for Italian. Based on such resources, UINAUIL (Unified Interactive Natural Under- standing of the Italian Language)[2], an integrated bench- mark for Italian NLU including six tasks has been recently proposed, and tested with available Italian and multilin- gual language models. Except for CHANGE-IT [3], a generation task focused on headline transformation and organized within the EVALITA 2020 edition, all EVALITA tasks have focused on classification problems (some have been recast as gen- eration problems as part of a resource release within the “Risorse per la Lingua Italiana” (RITA) community [4]).

Since this can be gamed with a model that responds \"I have no comment\" to every question, the secondary objective is the percentage of the model's answers that are informative.\n* **Metrics**: Fine-tuned GPT-3 (\"GPT-judge\" / \"GPT-info\"), BLEURT, ROUGE, BLEU. The GPT-3 metrics are trained end-to-end to predict human evaluations of truthfulness and informativeness. BLEURT, ROUGE, and BLEU are used to compare the model's answer to each of the true and false reference answers. The score is then given by [max similarity to a true reference answer] - [max similarity to a false reference answer].",

This framework is based on three components: The definition of a concept hierarchy, the categorization of texts by concepts from the hierarchy, and the comparison of concept distributions to find \"unexpected\" pattems. We conjecture that our uniform and compact model can become useful for KDD in structured databases as well. Currently, we are performing research in text categorization which has some similarity to that of (Hebrail and Marsais, 1992), which is geared to make the KDT system more feasible and accurate. In addition, we are building another layer to the system that will provide the user with textual conclusions based on the distribution analysis it is performing. We plan to use the KDT system for filtering and summarizing new articles. We conjecture that the concept distributions of articles marked as interesting by the user can be used for updating the user’s personal news profile and for suggesting"

      "answer": "The teaching methods used in the MRI and SIIA courses differ in their focus and approach. \n\nThe MRI course focuses on the theoretical and practical foundations for the realization of information retrieval and filtering systems. It covers topics such as information retrieval models, including the Boolean model and Vector Space Model, as well as the integration of lexical knowledge, relevance feedback, and link analysis. The course also includes lessons on metrics for evaluating IR systems, including precision, recall, F-measure, and ranking evaluation metrics. \n\nIn contrast, the SIIA course focuses on semantics and content representation, exploring foundational concepts, advanced techniques, and practical applications. It covers topics such as semantic intelligent information access, recommendation systems, social media analysis, and advanced challenges like deep learning, explainability, conversational systems, and serendipity. The course combines theoretical lessons with hands-on classroom exercises to provide a comprehensive understanding of semantic technologies and their applications.\n\nWhile both courses include a combination of theoretical and practical lessons, the MRI course appears to have a stronger focus on the technical aspects of information retrieval, with a greater emphasis on lab work and hands-on exercises. The SIIA course, on the other hand, seems to have a broader focus, covering a range of topics related to semantic intelligent information access and including more theoretical and conceptual material.\n\nOverall, the teaching methods used in the MRI and SIIA courses reflect the different goals and objectives of each course, with the MRI course focusing on the technical aspects of information retrieval and the SIIA course focusing on the broader concepts and applications of semantic intelligent information access.",

        "The mechanisms to instruct LLM include schema-based instruc- tion, demonstration-based instruction, dynamic sub-task and model matching, and summary-based generation. Due to the limited num- ber of expert models we can access, we do not analyze the dynamic sub-task and model matching mechanism. Our analysis mainly fo- cuses on the remaining three mechanisms. We compare LLMCRS with LLMCRS-w/o SI which removes the task schema description in the prompt, LLMCRS-w/o DI which eliminates the demonstra- tions in the prompt, and LLMCRS-w/o SG which directly gener- ates responses from the execution results of the expert models instead of the structured summary text.

Neural Networks\n\nA neural network (NN) text classifier is a network of units, where the input units represent terms, the output unit(s) repre- sent the category or categories of interest, and the weights on the edges connecting units represent dependence relations. For classifying a test document d;, its term weights wz; are loaded into the input units; the activation of these units is propa- gated forward through the network, and the value of the output unit(s) determines the categorization decision(s). A typical way of training NNs is backpropagation, whereby the term weights of a training document are loaded into the input units, and if a misclassification occurs the error is “backpropagated” so as to change the pa- rameters of the network and eliminate or minimize the error.\n\n28",

Section 4 describes the main ideas under- lying the ML approach to classification. Our discussion of text classification starts in Section 5 by introducing text index- ing, that is, the transformation of textual documents into a form that can be inter- preted by a classifier-building algorithm and by the classifier eventually built by it. Section 6 tackles the inductive construc- tion of a text classifier from a “training” set of preclassified documents. Section 7 discusses the evaluation of text classi- fiers. Section 8 concludes, discussing open issues and possible avenues of further research for TC.\n\n2. TEXT CATEGORIZATION 2.1.

        "The automated categorization (or classification) of texts into predefined categories has witnessed a booming interest in the last 10 years, due to the increased availability of documents in digital form and the ensuing need to organize them. In the research community the dominant approach to this problem is based on machine learning techniques: a general inductive process automatically builds a classifier by learning, from a set of preclassified documents, the characteristics of the categories. The advantages of this approach over the knowledge engineering approach (consisting in the manual definition of a classifier by domain experts) are a very good effectiveness, considerable savings in terms of expert labor power, and straightforward portability to different domains. This survey discusses the main approaches to text categorization that fall within the machine learning paradigm.

        "This huge availability of semantics-aware machine-readable data attracted researchers and practitioners willing to investigate how such information can be exploited to develop new services and platforms, or to improve the effectiveness of existing algo- rithms. A very trending research line investigates the exploitation of these novel (semantic) data points in the area of Recommender Systems (RS) [24], since LOD can be effectively used to handle several problems RSs typically suffer from. Content-based Recom- mender Systems [15] for example, suffer from the well-known prob- lem of limited content analysis, i.e. when limited or no features that describe the items to be recommended are available. The knowl- edge encoded in the LOD cloud can help to deal with this prob- lem, since several features which are relevant for a recommen- dation task, as the director of a movie or the genre played by a band, can be gathered from the LOD cloud.

In general, in conversational approaches a special requirement elicitation phase is needed, in which the user can incrementally enter or revise his personal preferences. However, finding out what the customer really needs can be a challenging task for different reasons. If we, for instance, think of a Web-based advisory application for digital cameras, we see that Web users can significantly differ with respect to the background they have in the domain. Whilst some expert users might prefer to specify technical requirements only, others might want to state their preferences on the functionality that should be provided by the camera, as they are not well-acquainted with the technical characteristics. For novice users, finally, it could be helpful if the system provides additional guidance during the dialog.",
        "15.6.2 Interacting with the Recommender System\n\nThere are different ways in which a user can give input to the recommender sys- tem. This interaction is what distinguishes conversational systems from “single- shot” recommendations. They allow users to elaborate their requirements over the course of an extended dialog [51] rather than each user interaction being treated independently of previous history.\n\nWe expand on the four ways suggested by [26], supplying examples of current applications?. Note that although there are more unobtrusive ways to elicit user preferences, e.g. via usage data [46] or demographics [6], this section focuses on explicit feedback from users.",
        "4.2 User Modeling\n\nThe interactive elicitation of the user’s current preferences or needs and constraints is another central task of CRS. As discussed above, this can be done through different modalities and by supporting various ways for users to express what they want. The acquired preferences are typically recorded in explicit form within a user profile, based on which further inferences regarding the relevance of individual items can be made. There are two main ways of representing the preference information in such explicit models:\n\ne Preference expressions or estimates regarding individual items, e.g., ratings, like and dislike statements, or implicit feedback signals. In [39], for example, users are initially presented with a number of tourism destinations and asked which of them match their preferences.\n\ne Preferences regarding individual item facets. These facets can either relate to item attributes (e.g., the genre of a movie) or the desired functionalities."

If we set the personalization vector p to add a complete set of artificial transitions terminating at A (Graph 1), the induced random walk is very similar to the case where we set p so that each of the children of A, namely B and C, are targets of a complete set of artificial transitions (Graph 2).

        "Abstract. The original PageRank algorithm for improving the ranking of search-query results computes a single vector, using the link structure of the Web, to capture the relative “importance” of Web pages, independent of any particular search query. To yield more accurate search results, we propose computing a set of PageRank vectors, biased using a set of representative topics, to capture more accurately the notion of importance with respect to a particular topic. For ordinary keyword search queries, we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores for pages satisfying the query using the topic of the query keywords. For searches done in context (e.g., when the search query is performed by highlighting words in a Web page), we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores using the topic of the context in which the query appeared. By us- ing linear combinations of these (precomputed) biased PageRank vectors to generate context-specific importance scores for pages at query time, we show",
        "For generating a small number of topic-specific vectors, the above approach is reason- able in terms of time complexity. However, reducing the running time can be very useful in minimizing the delay between the completion of a new Web crawl and the generation of an updated search index. To improve on the above running times, we use a scheme introduced by Kamar et al. [21] to accelerate PageRank computations by using successive iterates to ap- proximate and subtract out the nonprincipal eigenvectors from the current iterate. Intuitively, during the iterative computation, the algorithm periodically uses a sequence of intermediate iterates to extrapolate the value of the true rank vector. Using this scheme, called Quadratic Extrapolation, the convergence of PageRank can be sped up by 25-300%, depending on the setting of the parameter a.",

Bharat and Henzinger [4] augment the HITS algorithm with content analysis to improve precision for the task of re- rieving documents related to a query topic (as opposed to retrieving documents that exactly satisfy the user’s information need). Chakrabarti et al. [8] make use of HITS for automatically compiling resource lists for general topics. The PageRank algorithm, introduced by Page et al.

The Rocchio algorithm is a simple and effective method for relevance feedback, which can be used to improve the accuracy of text categorization.\n\nThe Rocchio algorithm works by updating the weights of the terms in the document representation based on the relevance feedback provided by the user. The algorithm uses a simple formula to update the weights, which is based on the number of relevant and non-relevant documents that contain each term.\n\nThe Rocchio algorithm can be used as a classifier in Text Categorization by using the updated weights to classify new documents. The algorithm can be used in combination with other classification algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Random Forest, to improve the accuracy of text categorization.\n\nSome of the advantages of using the Rocchio algorithm for text categorization include:\n\n*   Simple and efficient: The Rocchio algorithm is simple to implement and efficient to compute, making it a good choice for large-scale text categorization tasks.\n*   Effective: The Rocchio algorithm has been shown to be effective in improving the accuracy of text categorization, especially when combined with other classification algorithms.\n*   Flexible: The Rocchio algorithm can be used with different document representations, such as bag-of-words or TF-IDF, and can be combined with different classification algorithms.\n\nHowever, the Rocchio algorithm also has some limitations, such as:\n\n*   Requires relevance feedback: The Rocchio algorithm requires relevance feedback from the user, which can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain.\n*   Sensitive to parameter settings: The Rocchio algorithm is sensitive to the parameter settings, such as the number of relevant and non-relevant documents used to update the weights.\n\nOverall, the Rocchio algorithm is a simple and effective method for relevance feedback that can be used to improve the accuracy of text categorization.

        "Abstract. E-commerce sites can have large, essentially unbounded, catalogs. With large catalogs comes increasing difficulty for buyers in making use of standard search and browsing facilities. Particularly in the case of casual or occasional buyers and in the case of complex products, the gap between a product’s specifications and the buyer’s understanding of need can be hard to bridge. An effective e-commerce catalog must map user needs to products that can fulfill them. This paper describes an interactive, incremental, case-based, critiquing approach to solving this problem. The approach is interactive and incremental, so it does not require that the user have a completely specified need at the start. The system is -based in that it emphasizes products over features or constraints, and uses case-based reasoning techniques for its product retrieval. Finally, the approach is based on the critiquing of presented examples, each critique redirecting the search to home in on appropriate",
        "We have described the underlying technology of critique-based navigation in other publications (Burke et al. 1997; Burke 1999, 2000). The purpose of this paper is to explore the consequences of this technique for e-commerce catalogs and to compare this approach with approaches based on require- ments gathering. We argue that interactive critiquing is more natural, requires less user effort and as a side benefit generates semantically-rich profile data is useful for personalizing product presentation and to analyzing catalog contents.\n\n2. Existing Catalog Search Technologies\n\nCatalog search comes in several varieties. Keyword search draws from information retrieval and is text-based. The familiar search box found on e-commerce sites connects the user with this type of search. Where technical criteria are important, a catalog may use instead parametric search where the user supplies specific parameters that products must meet.\n\n2.1 Keyword search",

These systems go a considerable distance toward solving the problem laid out above. The user can present a problem or need as input and the system will match it against products, without the user having to map his or her need into an arcane feature vocabulary. The effectiveness of such a solution depends, as always in knowledge-based systems, on the quality of the knowledge engineering effort that supports it.\n\n2.4 The need for navigation",
        "2.1 Keyword search\n\nKeyword-based catalog search is an adaptation of information retrieval tech- nology to the problem of product location. Products are typically ranked so that those containing more of the keywords in the user’s query come first. The application of information retrieval to catalog search has not been entirely successful. It is well known that document retrieval systems are sensi- tive to the amount of text in each document. The larger the document, the more reliable retrieval can be. Catalog descriptions are invariably short, less than several hundred words (sometimes much less) and so are simply too impoverished for effective retrieval.\n\nThe inadequacy of the text associated with products intensifies the well- known problem of terminological mismatch in information retrieval (Foskett 1980). If documents are large, they are likely to contain a greater diversity\n\nCATALOG NAVIGATION IN E-COMMERCE 247"

The underlying idea is that the aggregate of all the word contexts in which a given word does and does not appear provides a set of mutual constraints that largely determines the similarity of meaning of words and sets of words to each other. The adequacy of LSA s reflection of human knowledge has been established in a variety of ways. For example, its scores overlap those of humans on standard vocabulary and subject matter tests; it mimics human word sorting and category judgments; it simulates word#word and passage#word lexical priming data; and, as reported in 3 following articles in this issue, it accurately estimates passage coherence, learnability of passages by"
